# Gen-Kart AI's Guide

A brief description of what this project does and how to setup.

## Run Locally

Go to the project directory

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

## To run Gen-Kart AI's server (Next.js app)
```npm run concurrent```:

Run multiple commands concurrently. Like npm run watch-js & npm run watch-less but better.

This command runs "npm run dev" and "nodemon ../local_server/index.js" on the GenKart_AI simultaneously.
